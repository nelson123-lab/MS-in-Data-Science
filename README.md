### Probability and Statistics (DASC 5302)
- Learned Descriptive Statistics, Discrete and Continouous Probability distributions, Hypothesis Testing and Hypothesis testing in Linear Regression.     

Assignments:-

[Repository](https://github.com/nelson123-lab/EXPERIMENTAL-DATA-COLLECTION-AND-DESCRIPTIVE-STATISTICS)
1) EXPERIMENTAL DATA COLLECTION AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS PART - I
    - Collected real-world data, performed descriptive statistics and made assumptions about the population distribution from the results of visualizations and               descriptive statistics.
3) EXPERIMENTAL DATA COLLECTION AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS PART - II
    - Performed goodness of fit chi-square test on the sample data collected to determine population distribution. Comparisonal study with the results from Part
